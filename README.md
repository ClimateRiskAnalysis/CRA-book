## Preamble

This Github repository contains the complete source code needed to generate the freely-available, open-source e-textbook, [*An Introduction to Climate Risk Management*](https://viveks.me/CRA-book).  The repository also contains the code examples that accompany the book. These code examples are in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).

Weâ€™d like to make *An Introduction to Climate Risk Analysis* as useful as possible. If you find a bug or have a comment about the book or a question about one of the exercises, please post an issue to this Github repository.

## Overview

Greenhouse gas emissions have caused considerable changes in climate, including increased surface air temperatures and rising sea levels.  Rising sea levels increase the risks of flooding for people living near the world's coastlines.  Managing such risks requires an understanding of many fields, including Earth science, statistics, and economics.  

*An Introduction to Climate Risk Analysis* teaches a framework for integrating Earth science and statistical concepts needed to analyze climate-related risks. We cover a range of topics relevant to probability, uncertainty quantification and characterization, and so individual chapters could be relevant for various audiences.
