# Contributor Bios

**Vivek Srikrishnan** is an Assistant Research Professor with the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Penn State. He studies decision-making under uncertain climate risks and feedbacks between natural and human systems. His research combines model development, uncertainty quantification, complex systems dynamics, and decision-making under uncertainty. He has a Ph.D. in Energy & Mineral Engineering from Penn State. Vivek's email address is vivek@psu.edu, and his Web site is at http://www.personal.psu.edu/vxs914.

**Patrick J. Applegate** is an Academic Editor at Research Square. In this role, Patrick helps researchers communicate their science and works on data science projects in Python. Patrick earned his Ph.D. in Geosciences at Penn State and is first author or co-author of 20 peer-reviewed scientific papers.  His research treats topics including ice sheets and their contributions to sea level rise, methods for estimating the ages of glacial deposits, and the application of statistical methods to problems in the geosciences.

**Tony E. Wong** is an Instructor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder). He received his PhD in Applied Mathematics from CU Boulder in 2016, and later was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Penn State's Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, before returning CU to pursue his love of teaching. His current research focuses on uncertainty quantification and model calibration in sea level and coastal storm surge projections. Tony's email address is anthony.e.wong@colorado.edu and his Web site is https://tonyewong.github.io.

**Ryan L. Sriver** is an Associate Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).  Prior to joining UIUC in the fall of 2012, he worked as a research associate in Penn State’s Department of Geosciences and as a NOAA Climate and Global Change postdoctoral fellow in Penn State’s Department of Meteorology.  He graduated from Purdue University with a Ph.D. in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.  His research seeks to develop a deeper understanding about the physical processes influencing variability within Earth’s climate system, and to quantify climate change uncertainties relevant to adaptation planning and decision-making.  Ryan's email address is rsriver@illinois.edu, and his Web site is at https://www.atmos.illinois.edu/~rsriver/index.html.

**Alexander Bakker** is a senior advisor at Rijkswaterstraat. He received a Masters in Civil Engineering from the Delft University of Technology and obtained a PhD in Regional climate change scenarios at VU University of Amsterdam.

**Kelsey L. Ruckert** is a geologist by training. She is a Scientific Programmer for the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Penn State. She specializes in geology, flood hazards, water quality, and climate change impacts where she excels in GIS, statistical analysis, modeling, and fieldwork. Her research focuses on understanding sea-level rise, storm surge, and water resources, and their implications to vulnerability and the design of risk management strategies. Her email address is klr324@psu.edu and her Web site is http://klr324.github.io.

**Klaus Keller** is a Professor of Geosciences at Penn State. Keller directs the Center for Climate Risk Management as well as the research network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (http://scrimhub.org).  Before joining Penn State, he worked as a research scientist and lecturer at Princeton University and as an engineer in Germany.  Professor Keller graduated from Princeton with a Ph.D. in civil and environmental engineering.  He received master’s degrees from M.I.T. and Princeton as well as an engineer’s degree from the Technische Universität Berlin.  His research addresses two interrelated questions.  First, how can we mechanistically understand past and potentially predict future changes in the climate system? Second, how can we use this information to design sustainable, scientifically sound, technologically feasible, economically efficient, and ethically defensible climate risk management strategies?  He analyzes these questions by mission-oriented basic research covering a wide range of disciplines such as Earth system science, economics, engineering, philosophy, decision science, and statistics.  Klaus' email address is klaus@psu.edu, and his Web site is at http://www3.geosc.psu.edu/~kzk10/.
