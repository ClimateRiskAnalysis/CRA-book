This work was supported by the National Science Foundation through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF cooperative agreement GEO-1240507.  Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.  Other support was provided by the [Center for Climate Risk Management](http://www.clima.psu.edu/index.php) and the [Rock Ethics Institute](http://rockethics.psu.edu).  

Most of these exercises were originally developed as part of a course titled [Risk Analysis in the Earth Sciences](http://bulletins.psu.edu/undergrad/courses/G/GEOSC/450/200910SP), developed and taught by Klaus Keller in the [Department of Geosciences](http://www.geosc.psu.edu) at the [Pennsylvania State University](http://www.psu.edu).  The exercises discussed in this lab manual were co-developed by a large group (see the individual chapters).  

Katerina Kostadinova designed the cover using a photograph provided by Chris Forest.  

Thomas Patrick Walsh and Naomi Radke made suggestions for improving the text and lab exercises.  

**Patrick Applegate** thanks the students from the Risk Analysis in the Earth Sciences course, Spring 2013 and Spring 2014, for many helpful comments that improved the exercises.  Patrick also thanks AJR for support during the writing of this e-textbook.  

**Klaus Keller** thanks all the students from the Risk Analysis course, the members of the Keller research group, and his SCRiM collaborators for invaluable inputs. Special thanks go to his family, many mentors, and friends for support.
