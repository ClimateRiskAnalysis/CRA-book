    "A key consideration in any modeling exercise is the mathematical representation of the modeled process. This choice can allow or prohibit certain relationships between variables, or may result in too many or too few parameters to appropriately capture dynamics. For example, a simple linear model in time, \n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "H_\\text{lin}(t) = a + b*(t - t_0),\n",
    "```\n",
    "where $H$ is global sea level in $m$, $t$ is time in years and $t_0$ is a baseline year, does not allow for accelerated sea-level rise. A quadratic model in time, \n",

    "However, both of these models assume that time is the key variable explaining changes in sea levels from one year to another. In [](sec:flood_intro), we discussed the relationship between CO_2 concentrations, atmospheric temperature, and sea levels. {cite:t}`rahmstorfSemiEmpiricalApproachProjecting2007` proposed the following semi-empirical model relating sea-level rise (SLR) to changes in global mean temperatures:\n",
