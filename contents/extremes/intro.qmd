# Extreme Value Analysis

## Overview

In this section, we will discuss approaches to analyzing extreme values, quantifying uncertainty, and representing nonstationarity.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this part, readers will be able to:

1. Distinguish between block maxima and peaks-over-threshold approaches to extreme value analysis;
2. Apply statistical methods to quantify uncertainty in extremes and return levels;
3. Select model structures using appropriate statistical methods.
