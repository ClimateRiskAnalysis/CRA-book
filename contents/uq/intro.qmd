# Uncertainty Quantification

## Overview

This chapter will introduce methods and goals for uncertainty quantification.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this part, readers will be able to:

1. Define uncertainty quantification;
2. Distinguish between the methods and assumptions for parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric approaches to statistics;
3. Conduct Monte Carlo simulation and compute Monte Carlo standard errors;
4. Quantify model uncertainties with the bootstrap and Markov chain Monte Carlo;
5. Demonstrate how emulation addresses the trade-off between model complexity and the ability to quantify uncertainties.
6. Evaluate different approaches to emulation based on problem characteristics.
